## Hello! Thanks for viewing my code. 
### This program is a ticket purchasing "website" that has a:
- homepage
- login page
- create new user account page
- ticket type and quantity selection page
- purchasing page for adding (fake) credit card information
- admin login and an admin view page. (if you are running the program in Visual Studio the admin login is "admin", password: BACS287)

This project was created using Visual Studio 2019 as the final project in UNCO BACS287.
