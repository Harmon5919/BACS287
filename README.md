GUI Programming BACS287 Final Project

## Hello! Thanks for viewing my code. 
### This program is a ticket purchasing "website" that has a:
- homepage frmGetTickets.cs
- login page frmLogin.cs
- create new user account page frmAcctCreation.cs
- ticket type and quantity selection page frmOrder.cs
- purchasing page for adding test data credit card information (No real credit card information stored) frmPurchase.cs
- admin login and an admin view page. frmAdminLogin.cs and frmAdmin.cs

This project was created using Visual Studio 2019 as the final project in UNCO BACS287.

Currently working on making the program run after being downloaded as a zip file from github.

Right now, if you try to download the zip file it will say the resource files are missing when you run it.
